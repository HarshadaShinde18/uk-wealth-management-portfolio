The portfolio is developed in line with a structured **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** and
includes:

Portfolio performance is analysed over a two-year period from  
**1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022**, incorporating both **risk and return characteristics**
and relevant **economic and market events** during the period.
